# JavaScript-EndGame

JavaScript Billiard with HTML5 and CSS.

The audio library (Howler.js) works only in developer browser such as Safari Technology Preview.

In order to make the library to work it is required to disable the AudioPolicy in Chrome Developer settings.

From previous tests the game was still able to play the audio library. It depends on the computer, the operative system and browser.

To run the game is enough to start index.html.

Enjoy!
